# Monthly Expenses App

Monthly Expenses app I made with TypeScript <br/>
<br/>
It is made to help you keep track of your monthly expenses by keeping all your spending<br/>
data in one place and converting it to US dollars.<br/>
<br/>
You can enter a short description to easily identify why you spent that money and then<br/>
you need to specify the amount of money you spent. You can choose to pass those values<br/>
in **US dollars (USD)** or **Argentine pesos (ARS)**, but the total for the month is returned in **USD** <br/>
<br/>
Clarification: The data used for the conversion is static and corresponds to the current<br/>
value on the date the repository was loaded. <br/>
<br/>

## How to set it up

To see how it works, simply clone this respository or a fork of this repository<br/>
and run `npm i` or `npm install` on the root (or main) folder.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have done this, if you are on the root folder, you can run `tsc -w`.<br/>
and then open the HTML file at `public/index.html`.
<br/>

## How to use it

It is a simple expenses app.<br/>
Just add a description and a cost in the input bar and then click<br/> on the blue **Add** button.
